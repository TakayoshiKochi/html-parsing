  <h4 id=writing-secure-applications-with-html>1.11.1 Writing secure applications with HTML<a href=#writing-secure-applications-with-html class=self-link></a></h4>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>When HTML is used to create interactive sites, care needs to be taken to avoid introducing
  vulnerabilities through which attackers can compromise the integrity of the site itself or of the
  site's users.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive study of this matter is beyond the scope of this document, and authors are
  strongly encouraged to study the matter in more detail. However, this section attempts to provide
  a quick introduction to some common pitfalls in HTML application development.</p>

  <p>The security model of the Web is based on the concept of "origins", and correspondingly many of
  the potential attacks on the Web involve cross-origin actions. <a href=#refsORIGIN>[ORIGIN]</a></p>

  <dl><dt>Not validating user input<dt>Cross-site scripting (XSS)<dt>SQL injection<dd>

    <p>When accepting untrusted input, e.g. user-generated content such as text comments, values in
    URL parameters, messages from third-party sites, etc, it is imperative that the data be
    validated before use, and properly escaped when displayed. Failing to do this can allow a
    hostile user to perform a variety of attacks, ranging from the potentially benign, such as
    providing bogus user information like a negative age, to the serious, such as running scripts
    every time a user looks at a page that includes the information, potentially propagating the
    attack in the process, to the catastrophic, such as deleting all data in the server.</p>

    <p>When writing filters to validate user input, it is imperative that filters always be
    safelist-based, allowing known-safe constructs and disallowing all other input. Blocklist-based
    filters that disallow known-bad inputs and allow everything else are not secure, as not
    everything that is bad is yet known (for example, because it might be invented in the
    future).</p>

    <div class=example>

     <p>For example, suppose a page looked at its URL's query string to determine what to display,
     and the site then redirected the user to that page to display a message, as in:</p>

     <pre>&lt;ul>
 &lt;li>&lt;a href="message.cgi?say=Hello">Say Hello&lt;/a>
 &lt;li>&lt;a href="message.cgi?say=Welcome">Say Welcome&lt;/a>
 &lt;li>&lt;a href="message.cgi?say=Kittens">Say Kittens&lt;/a>
&lt;/ul></pre>

     <p>If the message was just displayed to the user without escaping, a hostile attacker could
     then craft a URL that contained a script element:</p>

     <pre>https://example.com/message.cgi?say=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27Oh%20no%21%27%29%3C/script%3E</pre>

     <p>If the attacker then convinced a victim user to visit this page, a script of the attacker's
     choosing would run on the page. Such a script could do any number of hostile actions, limited
     only by what the site offers: if the site is an e-commerce shop, for instance, such a script
     could cause the user to unknowingly make arbitrarily many unwanted purchases.</p>

     <p>This is called a cross-site scripting attack.</p>

    </div>

    <p>There are many constructs that can be used to try to trick a site into executing code. Here
    are some that authors are encouraged to consider when writing safelist filters:</p>

    <ul><li>When allowing harmless-seeming elements like <code id=writing-secure-applications-with-html:the-img-element><a href=#the-img-element>img</a></code>, it is important to safelist
     any provided attributes as well. If one allowed all attributes then an attacker could, for
     instance, use the <code id=writing-secure-applications-with-html:handler-onload><a href=#handler-onload>onload</a></code> attribute to run arbitrary
     script.<li>When allowing URLs to be provided (e.g. for links), the scheme of each URL also needs to be
     explicitly safelisted, as there are many schemes that can be abused. The most prominent
     example is "<code id=writing-secure-applications-with-html:javascript-protocol><a href=#javascript-protocol>javascript:</a></code>", but user agents can
     implement (and indeed, have historically implemented) others.<li>Allowing a <code id=writing-secure-applications-with-html:the-base-element><a href=#the-base-element>base</a></code> element to be inserted means any <code id=writing-secure-applications-with-html:the-script-element><a href=#the-script-element>script</a></code> elements
     in the page with relative links can be hijacked, and similarly that any form submissions can
     get redirected to a hostile site.</ul>

   <dt>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)<dd>

    <p>If a site allows a user to make form submissions with user-specific side-effects, for example
    posting messages on a forum under the user's name, making purchases, or applying for a passport,
    it is important to verify that the request was made by the user intentionally, rather than by
    another site tricking the user into making the request unknowingly.</p>

    <p>This problem exists because HTML forms can be submitted to other origins.</p>

    <p>Sites can prevent such attacks by populating forms with user-specific hidden tokens, or by
    checking `<code id=writing-secure-applications-with-html:http-origin><a data-x-internal=http-origin href=https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-origin>Origin</a></code>` headers on all requests.</p>

   <dt>Clickjacking<dd>

    <p>A page that provides users with an interface to perform actions that the user might not wish
    to perform needs to be designed so as to avoid the possibility that users can be tricked into
    activating the interface.</p>

    <p>One way that a user could be so tricked is if a hostile site places the victim site in a
    small <code id=writing-secure-applications-with-html:the-iframe-element><a href=#the-iframe-element>iframe</a></code> and then convinces the user to click, for instance by having the user
    play a reaction game. Once the user is playing the game, the hostile site can quickly position
    the iframe under the mouse cursor just as the user is about to click, thus tricking the user
    into clicking the victim site's interface.</p>

    <p>To avoid this, sites that do not expect to be used in frames are encouraged to only enable
    their interface if they detect that they are not in a frame (e.g. by comparing the <code id=writing-secure-applications-with-html:dom-window><a href=#dom-window>window</a></code> object to the value of the <code id=writing-secure-applications-with-html:dom-top><a href=#dom-top>top</a></code>
    attribute).</p>

  <h4 id=common-pitfalls-to-avoid-when-using-the-scripting-apis>1.11.2 Common pitfalls to avoid when using the scripting APIs<a href=#common-pitfalls-to-avoid-when-using-the-scripting-apis class=self-link></a></h4>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>Scripts in HTML have "run-to-completion" semantics, meaning that the browser will generally run
  the script uninterrupted before doing anything else, such as firing further events or continuing
  to parse the document.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, parsing of HTML files happens incrementally, meaning that
  the parser can pause at any point to let scripts run. This is generally a good thing, but it does
  mean that authors need to be careful to avoid hooking event handlers after the events could have
  possibly fired.</p>

  <p>There are two techniques for doing this reliably: use <a href=#event-handler-content-attributes id=common-pitfalls-to-avoid-when-using-the-scripting-apis:event-handler-content-attributes>event handler content
  attributes</a>, or create the element and add the event handlers in the same script. The latter
  is safe because, as mentioned earlier, scripts are run to completion before further events can
  fire.</p>

  <div class=example>

   <p>One way this could manifest itself is with <code id=common-pitfalls-to-avoid-when-using-the-scripting-apis:the-img-element><a href=#the-img-element>img</a></code> elements and the <code id=common-pitfalls-to-avoid-when-using-the-scripting-apis:event-load><a href=#event-load>load</a></code> event. The event could fire as soon as the element has been
   parsed, especially if the image has already been cached (which is common).</p>

   <p>Here, the author uses the <code id=common-pitfalls-to-avoid-when-using-the-scripting-apis:handler-onload><a href=#handler-onload>onload</a></code> handler on an
   <code id=common-pitfalls-to-avoid-when-using-the-scripting-apis:the-img-element-2><a href=#the-img-element>img</a></code> element to catch the <code id=common-pitfalls-to-avoid-when-using-the-scripting-apis:event-load-2><a href=#event-load>load</a></code> event:</p>

   <pre>&lt;img src="games.png" alt="Games" onload="gamesLogoHasLoaded(event)"></pre>

   <p>If the element is being added by script, then so long as the event handlers are added in the
   same script, the event will still not be missed:</p>

   <pre>&lt;script>
 var img = new Image();
 img.src = 'games.png';
 img.alt = 'Games';
 img.onload = gamesLogoHasLoaded;
 // img.addEventListener('load', gamesLogoHasLoaded, false); // would work also
&lt;/script></pre>

   <p>However, if the author first created the <code id=common-pitfalls-to-avoid-when-using-the-scripting-apis:the-img-element-3><a href=#the-img-element>img</a></code> element and then in a separate
   script added the event listeners, there's a chance that the <code id=common-pitfalls-to-avoid-when-using-the-scripting-apis:event-load-3><a href=#event-load>load</a></code>
   event would be fired in between, leading it to be missed:</p>

   <pre class=bad>&lt;!-- Do not use this style, it has a race condition! -->
 &lt;img id="games" src="games.png" alt="Games">
 &lt;!-- the 'load' event might fire here while the parser is taking a
      break, in which case you will not see it! -->
 &lt;script>
  var img = document.getElementById('games');
  img.onload = gamesLogoHasLoaded; // might never fire!
 &lt;/script></pre>

  </div>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>Authors are encouraged to make use of conformance checkers (also known as <i>validators</i>) to
  catch common mistakes. The WHATWG maintains a list of such tools at: <a href=https://validator.whatwg.org/>https://validator.whatwg.org/</a></p>



  <h3 id=conformance-requirements-for-authors>1.12 Conformance requirements for authors<a href=#conformance-requirements-for-authors class=self-link></a></h3>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>Unlike previous versions of the HTML specification, this specification defines in some detail
  the required processing for invalid documents as well as valid documents.</p> 

  <p>However, even though the processing of invalid content is in most cases well-defined,
  conformance requirements for documents are still important: in practice, interoperability (the
  situation in which all implementations process particular content in a reliable and identical or
  equivalent way) is not the only goal of document conformance requirements. This section details
  some of the more common reasons for still distinguishing between a conforming document and one
  with errors.</p>


  <h4 id=presentational-markup>1.12.1 Presentational markup<a href=#presentational-markup class=self-link></a></h4>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>The majority of presentational features from previous versions of HTML are no longer allowed.
  Presentational markup in general has been found to have a number of problems:</p>

  <dl><dt>The use of presentational elements leads to poorer accessibility<dd>

    <p>While it is possible to use presentational markup in a way that provides users of assistive
    technologies (ATs) with an acceptable experience (e.g. using ARIA), doing so is significantly
    more difficult than doing so when using semantically-appropriate markup. Furthermore, even using
    such techniques doesn't help make pages accessible for non-AT non-graphical users, such as users
    of text-mode browsers.</p>

    <p>Using media-independent markup, on the other hand, provides an easy way for documents to be
    authored in such a way that they work for more users (e.g. users of text browsers).</p>

   <dt>Higher cost of maintenance<dd>

    <p>It is significantly easier to maintain a site written in such a way that the markup is
    style-independent. For example, changing the color of a site that uses <code>&lt;font color=""></code> throughout requires changes across the entire site,
    whereas a similar change to a site based on CSS can be done by changing a single file.</p>

   <dt>Larger document sizes<dd>

    <p>Presentational markup tends to be much more redundant, and thus results in larger document
    sizes.</p>

   </dl>

  <p>For those reasons, presentational markup has been removed from HTML in this version. This
  change should not come as a surprise; HTML4 deprecated presentational markup many years ago and
  provided a mode (HTML4 Transitional) to help authors move away from presentational markup; later,
  XHTML 1.1 went further and obsoleted those features altogether.</p>

  <p>The only remaining presentational markup features in HTML are the <code id=presentational-markup:the-style-attribute><a href=#the-style-attribute>style</a></code> attribute and the <code id=presentational-markup:the-style-element><a href=#the-style-element>style</a></code> element. Use of the <code id=presentational-markup:the-style-attribute-2><a href=#the-style-attribute>style</a></code> attribute is somewhat discouraged in production environments, but
  it can be useful for rapid prototyping (where its rules can be directly moved into a separate
  style sheet later) and for providing specific styles in unusual cases where a separate style sheet
  would be inconvenient. Similarly, the <code id=presentational-markup:the-style-element-2><a href=#the-style-element>style</a></code> element can be useful in syndication or
  for page-specific styles, but in general an external style sheet is likely to be more convenient
  when the styles apply to multiple pages.</p>

  <p>It is also worth noting that some elements that were previously presentational have been
  redefined in this specification to be media-independent: <code id=presentational-markup:the-b-element><a href=#the-b-element>b</a></code>, <code id=presentational-markup:the-i-element><a href=#the-i-element>i</a></code>,
  <code id=presentational-markup:the-hr-element><a href=#the-hr-element>hr</a></code>, <code id=presentational-markup:the-s-element><a href=#the-s-element>s</a></code>, <code id=presentational-markup:the-small-element><a href=#the-small-element>small</a></code>, and <code id=presentational-markup:the-u-element><a href=#the-u-element>u</a></code>.</p>


  <h4 id=syntax-errors>1.12.2 Syntax errors<a href=#syntax-errors class=self-link></a></h4>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>The syntax of HTML is constrained to avoid a wide variety of problems.</p>

  <dl><dt>Unintuitive error-handling behavior<dd>

    <p>Certain invalid syntax constructs, when parsed, result in DOM trees that are highly
    unintuitive.</p>

    <div class=example>

     <p>For example, the following markup fragment results in a DOM with an <code id=syntax-errors:the-hr-element><a href=#the-hr-element>hr</a></code> element
     that is an <em>earlier</em> sibling of the corresponding <code id=syntax-errors:the-table-element><a href=#the-table-element>table</a></code> element:</p>

     <pre class=bad>&lt;table>&lt;hr>...</pre>

    </div>

   <dt>Errors with optional error recovery<dd>

    <p>To allow user agents to be used in controlled environments without having to implement the
    more bizarre and convoluted error handling rules, user agents are permitted to fail whenever
    encountering a <a href=#parse-error id=syntax-errors:parse-error>parse error</a>.</p>

   <dt>Errors where the error-handling behavior is not compatible with streaming user agents<dd>

    <p>Some error-handling behavior, such as the behavior for the <code>&lt;table>&lt;hr>...</code> example mentioned above, are incompatible with streaming
    user agents (user agents that process HTML files in one pass, without storing state). To avoid
    interoperability problems with such user agents, any syntax resulting in such behavior is
    considered invalid.</p>

   <dt>Errors that can result in infoset coercion<dd>

    <p>When a user agent based on XML is connected to an HTML parser, it is possible that certain
    invariants that XML enforces, such as element or attribute names never contain multiple colons,
    will be violated by an HTML file. Handling this can require that the parser coerce the HTML DOM
    into an XML-compatible infoset. Most syntax constructs that require such handling are considered
    invalid. (Comments containing two consecutive hyphens, or ending with a hyphen, are exceptions
    that are allowed in the HTML syntax.)</p>

   <dt>Errors that result in disproportionately poor performance<dd>

    <p>Certain syntax constructs can result in disproportionately poor performance. To discourage the
    use of such constructs, they are typically made non-conforming.</p>

    <div class=example>

     <p>For example, the following markup results in poor performance, since all the unclosed
     <code id=syntax-errors:the-i-element><a href=#the-i-element>i</a></code> elements have to be reconstructed in each paragraph, resulting in progressively
     more elements in each paragraph:</p>

     <pre class=bad>&lt;p>&lt;i>She dreamt.
&lt;p>&lt;i>She dreamt that she ate breakfast.
&lt;p>&lt;i>Then lunch.
&lt;p>&lt;i>And finally dinner.</pre>

     <p>The resulting DOM for this fragment would be:</p>

     <ul class=domTree><li class=t1><code id=syntax-errors:the-p-element><a href=#the-p-element>p</a></code><ul><li class=t1><code id=syntax-errors:the-i-element-2><a href=#the-i-element>i</a></code><ul><li class=t3><code id=syntax-errors:text><a data-x-internal=text href=https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-text>#text</a></code>: <span>She dreamt.</span></ul></ul><li class=t1><code id=syntax-errors:the-p-element-2><a href=#the-p-element>p</a></code><ul><li class=t1><code id=syntax-errors:the-i-element-3><a href=#the-i-element>i</a></code><ul><li class=t1><code id=syntax-errors:the-i-element-4><a href=#the-i-element>i</a></code><ul><li class=t3><code id=syntax-errors:text-2><a data-x-internal=text href=https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-text>#text</a></code>: <span>She dreamt that she ate breakfast.</span></ul></ul></ul><li class=t1><code id=syntax-errors:the-p-element-3><a href=#the-p-element>p</a></code><ul><li class=t1><code id=syntax-errors:the-i-element-5><a href=#the-i-element>i</a></code><ul><li class=t1><code id=syntax-errors:the-i-element-6><a href=#the-i-element>i</a></code><ul><li class=t1><code id=syntax-errors:the-i-element-7><a href=#the-i-element>i</a></code><ul><li class=t3><code id=syntax-errors:text-3><a data-x-internal=text href=https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-text>#text</a></code>: <span>Then lunch.</span></ul></ul></ul></ul><li class=t1><code id=syntax-errors:the-p-element-4><a href=#the-p-element>p</a></code><ul><li class=t1><code id=syntax-errors:the-i-element-8><a href=#the-i-element>i</a></code><ul><li class=t1><code id=syntax-errors:the-i-element-9><a href=#the-i-element>i</a></code><ul><li class=t1><code id=syntax-errors:the-i-element-10><a href=#the-i-element>i</a></code><ul><li class=t1><code id=syntax-errors:the-i-element-11><a href=#the-i-element>i</a></code><ul><li class=t3><code id=syntax-errors:text-4><a data-x-internal=text href=https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-text>#text</a></code>: <span>And finally dinner.</span></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul>

    </div>

   <dt>Errors involving fragile syntax constructs<dd>

    <p>There are syntax constructs that, for historical reasons, are relatively fragile. To help
    reduce the number of users who accidentally run into such problems, they are made
    non-conforming.</p>

    <div class=example>

     <p>For example, the parsing of certain named character references in attributes happens even
     with the closing semicolon being omitted. It is safe to include an ampersand followed by
     letters that do not form a named character reference, but if the letters are changed to a
     string that <em>does</em> form a named character reference, they will be interpreted as that
     character instead.</p>

     <p>In this fragment, the attribute's value is "<code>?bill&amp;ted</code>":</p>

     <pre class=bad>&lt;a href="?bill&amp;ted">Bill and Ted&lt;/a></pre>

     <p>In the following fragment, however, the attribute's value is actually "<code>?art©</code>", <em>not</em> the intended "<code>?art&amp;copy</code>",
     because even without the final semicolon, "<code>&amp;copy</code>" is handled the same
     as "<code>&amp;copy;</code>" and thus gets interpreted as "<code>©</code>":</p>

     <pre class=bad>&lt;a href="?art&amp;copy">Art and Copy&lt;/a></pre>

     <p>To avoid this problem, all named character references are required to end with a semicolon,
     and uses of named character references without a semicolon are flagged as errors.</p>

     <p>Thus, the correct way to express the above cases is as
     follows:</p>

     <pre>&lt;a href="?bill&amp;ted">Bill and Ted&lt;/a> &lt;!-- &amp;ted is ok, since it's not a named character reference --></pre>
     <pre>&lt;a href="?art&amp;amp;copy">Art and Copy&lt;/a> &lt;!-- the &amp; has to be escaped, since &amp;copy <em>is</em> a named character reference --></pre>

    </div>

   <dt>Errors involving known interoperability problems in legacy user agents<dd>

    <p>Certain syntax constructs are known to cause especially subtle or serious problems in legacy
    user agents, and are therefore marked as non-conforming to help authors avoid them.</p>

    <div class=example>

     <p>For example, this is why the U+0060 GRAVE ACCENT character (`) is not allowed in unquoted
     attributes. In certain legacy user agents,  it is sometimes treated as a
     quote character.</p>

    </div>

    <div class=example>

     <p>Another example of this is the DOCTYPE, which is required to trigger <a id=syntax-errors:no-quirks-mode href=https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document-no-quirks data-x-internal=no-quirks-mode>no-quirks
     mode</a>, because the behavior of legacy user agents in <a id=syntax-errors:quirks-mode href=https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document-quirks data-x-internal=quirks-mode>quirks mode</a> is often
     largely undocumented.</p>

    </div>

   <dt>Errors that risk exposing authors to security attacks<dd>

    <p>Certain restrictions exist purely to avoid known security problems.</p>

    <div class=example>

     <p>For example, the restriction on using UTF-7 exists purely to avoid authors falling prey to a
     known cross-site-scripting attack using UTF-7. <a href=#refsUTF7>[UTF7]</a></p>

    </div>

   <dt>Cases where the author's intent is unclear<dd>

    <p>Markup where the author's intent is very unclear is often made non-conforming. Correcting
    these errors early makes later maintenance easier.</p>

    <div class=example>

     <p>For example, it is unclear whether the author intended the following to be an
     <code id=syntax-errors:the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements><a href=#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements>h1</a></code> heading or an <code id=syntax-errors:the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements-2><a href=#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements>h2</a></code> heading:</p>

     <pre class=bad>&lt;h1>Contact details&lt;/h2></pre>

    </div>

   <dt>Cases that are likely to be typos<dd>

    <p>When a user makes a simple typo, it is helpful if the error can be caught early, as this can
    save the author a lot of debugging time. This specification therefore usually considers it an
    error to use element names, attribute names, and so forth, that do not match the names defined
    in this specification.</p>

    <div class=example>

     <p>For example, if the author typed <code>&lt;capton></code> instead of <code>&lt;caption></code>, this would be flagged as an error and the author could correct
     the typo immediately.</p>

    </div>

   <dt>Errors that could interfere with new syntax in the future<dd>

    <p>In order to allow the language syntax to be extended in the future, certain otherwise
    harmless features are disallowed.</p>

    <div class=example>

     <p>For example, "attributes" in end tags are ignored currently, but they are invalid, in case a
     future change to the language makes use of that syntax feature without conflicting with
     already-deployed (and valid!) content.</p>

    </div>

   </dl>

  <p>Some authors find it helpful to be in the practice of always quoting all attributes and always
  including all optional tags, preferring the consistency derived from such custom over the minor
  benefits of terseness afforded by making use of the flexibility of the HTML syntax. To aid such
  authors, conformance checkers can provide modes of operation wherein such conventions are
  enforced.</p>



  <h4 id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values>1.12.3 Restrictions on content models and on attribute values<a href=#restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values class=self-link></a></h4>

  <p><i>This section is non-normative.</i></p>

  <p>Beyond the syntax of the language, this specification also places restrictions on how elements
  and attributes can be specified. These restrictions are present for similar reasons:</p>

  <dl><dt>Errors involving content with dubious semantics<dd>

    <p>To avoid misuse of elements with defined meanings, content models are defined that restrict
    how elements can be nested when such nestings would be of dubious value.</p>

    <p class=example>For example, this specification disallows nesting a <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-section-element><a href=#the-section-element>section</a></code>
    element inside a <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-kbd-element><a href=#the-kbd-element>kbd</a></code> element, since it is highly unlikely for an author to indicate
    that an entire section should be keyed in.</p>

   <dt>Errors that involve a conflict in expressed semantics<dd>

    <p>Similarly, to draw the author's attention to mistakes in the use of elements, clear
    contradictions in the semantics expressed are also considered conformance errors.</p>

    <div class=example>

     <p>In the fragments below, for example, the semantics are nonsensical: a separator cannot
     simultaneously be a cell, nor can a radio button be a progress bar.</p>

     <pre class=bad>&lt;hr role="cell"></pre>
     <pre class=bad>&lt;input type=radio role=progressbar></pre>

    </div>

    <p class=example>Another example is the restrictions on the content models of the
    <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-ul-element><a href=#the-ul-element>ul</a></code> element, which only allows <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-li-element><a href=#the-li-element>li</a></code> element children. Lists by definition
    consist just of zero or more list items, so if a <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-ul-element-2><a href=#the-ul-element>ul</a></code> element contains something
    other than an <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-li-element-2><a href=#the-li-element>li</a></code> element, it's not clear what was meant.</p>

   <dt>Cases where the default styles are likely to lead to confusion<dd>

    <p>Certain elements have default styles or behaviors that make certain combinations likely to
    lead to confusion. Where these have equivalent alternatives without this problem, the confusing
    combinations are disallowed.</p>

    <p class=example>For example, <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-div-element><a href=#the-div-element>div</a></code> elements are rendered as <a href=https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/visuren.html#x9 id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:block-box data-x-internal=block-box>block boxes</a>, and <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-span-element><a href=#the-span-element>span</a></code> elements as <a href=https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/visuren.html#inline-box id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:inline-box data-x-internal=inline-box>inline boxes</a>. Putting a <a id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:block-box-2 href=https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/visuren.html#x9 data-x-internal=block-box>block box</a> in an
    <a id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:inline-box-2 href=https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/visuren.html#inline-box data-x-internal=inline-box>inline box</a> is unnecessarily confusing; since either nesting just <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-div-element-2><a href=#the-div-element>div</a></code>
    elements, or nesting just <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-span-element-2><a href=#the-span-element>span</a></code> elements, or nesting <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-span-element-3><a href=#the-span-element>span</a></code> elements
    inside <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-div-element-3><a href=#the-div-element>div</a></code> elements all serve the same purpose as nesting a <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-div-element-4><a href=#the-div-element>div</a></code>
    element in a <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-span-element-4><a href=#the-span-element>span</a></code> element, but only the latter involves a <a id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:block-box-3 href=https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/visuren.html#x9 data-x-internal=block-box>block box</a> in
    an <a id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:inline-box-3 href=https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/visuren.html#inline-box data-x-internal=inline-box>inline box</a>, the latter combination is disallowed.</p>

    <p class=example>Another example would be the way <a href=#interactive-content-2 id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:interactive-content-2>interactive content</a> cannot be
    nested. For example, a <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-button-element><a href=#the-button-element>button</a></code> element cannot contain a <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-textarea-element><a href=#the-textarea-element>textarea</a></code>
    element. This is because the default behavior of such nesting interactive elements would be
    highly confusing to users. Instead of nesting these elements, they can be placed side by
    side.</p>

   <dt>Errors that indicate a likely misunderstanding of the specification<dd>

    <p>Sometimes, something is disallowed because allowing it would likely cause author
    confusion.</p>

    <p class=example>For example, setting the <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:attr-fe-disabled><a href=#attr-fe-disabled>disabled</a></code>
    attribute to the value "<code>false</code>" is disallowed, because despite the
    appearance of meaning that the element is enabled, it in fact means that the element is
    <em>disabled</em> (what matters for implementations is the presence of the attribute, not its
    value).</p>

   <dt>Errors involving limits that have been imposed merely to simplify the language<dd>

    <p>Some conformance errors simplify the language that authors need to learn.</p>

    <p class=example>For example, the <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-area-element><a href=#the-area-element>area</a></code> element's <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:attr-area-shape><a href=#attr-area-shape>shape</a></code> attribute, despite accepting both <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:attr-area-shape-keyword-circ><a href=#attr-area-shape-keyword-circ>circ</a></code> and <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:attr-area-shape-keyword-circle><a href=#attr-area-shape-keyword-circle>circle</a></code> values in practice as synonyms, disallows
    the use of the <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:attr-area-shape-keyword-circ-2><a href=#attr-area-shape-keyword-circ>circ</a></code> value, so as to simplify
    tutorials and other learning aids. There would be no benefit to allowing both, but it would
    cause extra confusion when teaching the language.</p>

   <dt>Errors that involve peculiarities of the parser<dd>

    <p>Certain elements are parsed in somewhat eccentric ways (typically for historical reasons),
    and their content model restrictions are intended to avoid exposing the author to these
    issues.</p>

    <div class=example>

     <p>For example, a <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-form-element><a href=#the-form-element>form</a></code> element isn't allowed inside <a href=#phrasing-content-2 id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:phrasing-content-2>phrasing content</a>,
     because when parsed as HTML, a <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-form-element-2><a href=#the-form-element>form</a></code> element's start tag will imply a
     <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-p-element><a href=#the-p-element>p</a></code> element's end tag. Thus, the following markup results in two <a href=#paragraph id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:paragraph>paragraphs</a>, not one:</p>

     <pre>&lt;p>Welcome. &lt;form>&lt;label>Name:&lt;/label> &lt;input>&lt;/form></pre>

     <p>It is parsed exactly like the following:</p>

     <pre>&lt;p>Welcome. &lt;/p>&lt;form>&lt;label>Name:&lt;/label> &lt;input>&lt;/form></pre>

    </div>

   <dt>Errors that would likely result in scripts failing in hard-to-debug ways<dd>

    <p>Some errors are intended to help prevent script problems that would be hard to debug.</p>

    <p class=example>This is why, for instance, it is non-conforming to have two <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-id-attribute><a href=#the-id-attribute>id</a></code> attributes with the same value. Duplicate IDs lead to the wrong
    element being selected, with sometimes disastrous effects whose cause is hard to determine.</p>

   <dt>Errors that waste authoring time<dd>

    <p>Some constructs are disallowed because historically they have been the cause of a lot of
    wasted authoring time, and by encouraging authors to avoid making them, authors can save time in
    future efforts.</p>

    <p class=example>For example, a <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-script-element><a href=#the-script-element>script</a></code> element's <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:attr-script-src><a href=#attr-script-src>src</a></code> attribute causes the element's contents to be ignored.
    However, this isn't obvious, especially if the element's contents appear to be executable script
    — which can lead to authors spending a lot of time trying to debug the inline script
    without realizing that it is not executing. To reduce this problem, this specification makes it
    non-conforming to have executable script in a <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:the-script-element-2><a href=#the-script-element>script</a></code> element when the <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:attr-script-src-2><a href=#attr-script-src>src</a></code> attribute is present. This means that authors who are
    validating their documents are less likely to waste time with this kind of mistake.</p>

   <dt>Errors that involve areas that affect authors migrating between the HTML and XML
   syntaxes<dd>

    <p>Some authors like to write files that can be interpreted as both XML and HTML with similar
    results. Though this practice is discouraged in general due to the myriad of subtle
    complications involved (especially when involving scripting, styling, or any kind of automated
    serialization), this specification has a few restrictions intended to at least somewhat mitigate
    the difficulties. This makes it easier for authors to use this as a transitionary step when
    migrating between the HTML and XML syntaxes.</p>

    <p class=example>For example, there are somewhat complicated rules surrounding the <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:attr-lang><a href=#attr-lang>lang</a></code> and <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:attr-xml-lang><a href=#attr-xml-lang>xml:lang</a></code> attributes
    intended to keep the two synchronized.</p>

    <p class=example>Another example would be the restrictions on the values of <code>xmlns</code> attributes in the HTML serialization, which are intended to ensure that
    elements in conforming documents end up in the same namespaces whether processed as HTML or
    XML.</p>

   <dt>Errors that involve areas reserved for future expansion<dd>

    <p>As with the restrictions on the syntax intended to allow for new syntax in future revisions
    of the language, some restrictions on the content models of elements and values of attributes
    are intended to allow for future expansion of the HTML vocabulary.</p>

    <p class=example>For example, limiting the values of the <code id=restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values:attr-hyperlink-target><a href=#attr-hyperlink-target>target</a></code> attribute that start with an U+005F LOW LINE
    character (_) to only specific predefined values allows new predefined values to be introduced
    at a future time without conflicting with author-defined values.</p>

   <dt>Errors that indicate a mis-use of other specifications<dd>

    <p>Certain restrictions are intended to support the restrictions made by other
    specifications.</p>

    <p class=example>For example, requiring that attributes that take media query lists use only
    <em>valid</em> media query lists reinforces the importance of following the conformance rules of
    that specification.</p>

  <h2 id=infrastructure>2 Common infrastructure<a href=#infrastructure class=self-link></a></h2>

  <p>This specification depends on the WHATWG Infra standard. <a href=#refsINFRA>[INFRA]</a></p>

  <h3 id=terminology>2.1 Terminology<a href=#terminology class=self-link></a></h3>

  <p>This specification refers to both HTML and XML attributes and IDL attributes, often in the same
  context. When it is not clear which is being referred to, they are referred to as <dfn>content attributes</dfn> for HTML and XML attributes, and <dfn>IDL
  attributes</dfn> for those defined on IDL interfaces. Similarly, the term "properties" is used for
  both JavaScript object properties and CSS properties. When these are ambiguous they are qualified
  as <dfn>object properties</dfn> and <dfn>CSS properties</dfn> respectively.</p>

  <p>Generally, when the specification states that a feature applies to <a href=#syntax id=terminology:syntax>the HTML syntax</a>
  or <a href=#the-xhtml-syntax id=terminology:the-xhtml-syntax>the XML syntax</a>, it also includes the other. When a feature specifically only
  applies to one of the two languages, it is called out by explicitly stating that it does not apply
  to the other format, as in "for HTML, ... (this does not apply to XML)".</p>

  <p>This specification uses the term <dfn>document</dfn> to refer to any use of HTML,
  ranging from short static documents to long essays or reports with rich multimedia, as well as to
  fully-fledged interactive applications. The term is used to refer both to <code id=terminology:document><a href=#document>Document</a></code>
  objects and their descendant DOM trees, and to serialized byte streams using the <a href=#syntax id=terminology:syntax-2>HTML syntax</a> or the <a href=#the-xhtml-syntax id=terminology:the-xhtml-syntax-2>XML syntax</a>, depending
  on context.</p>

  <p>In the context of the DOM structures, the terms <a href=https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#html-document id=terminology:html-documents data-x-internal=html-documents>HTML
  document</a> and <a href=https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#xml-document id=terminology:xml-documents data-x-internal=xml-documents>XML document</a> are used as defined in the DOM
  specification, and refer specifically to two different modes that <code id=terminology:document-2><a href=#document>Document</a></code> objects
  can find themselves in. <a href=#refsDOM>[DOM]</a> (Such uses are always hyperlinked to their
  definition.)</p>

  <p>In the context of byte streams, the term HTML document refers to resources labeled as
  <code id=terminology:text/html><a href=#text/html>text/html</a></code>, and the term XML document refers to resources labeled with an <a id=terminology:xml-mime-type href=https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/#xml-mime-type data-x-internal=xml-mime-type>XML
  MIME type</a>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>For simplicity, terms such as <dfn>shown</dfn>, <dfn>displayed</dfn>, and
  <dfn>visible</dfn> might sometimes be used when referring to the way a document is
  rendered to the user. These terms are not meant to imply a visual medium; they must be considered
  to apply to other media in equivalent ways.</p>

  

  <p>When an algorithm B says to return to another algorithm A, it implies that A called B. Upon
  returning to A, the implementation must continue from where it left off in calling B. Some
  algorithms run <dfn id=in-parallel data-export="">in parallel</dfn>; this means that the algorithm's subsequent
  steps are to be run, one after another, at the same time as other logic in the specification (e.g.
  at the same time as the <a href=#event-loop id=terminology:event-loop>event loop</a>). This specification does not define the precise
  mechanism by which this is achieved, be it time-sharing cooperative multitasking, fibers, threads,
  processes, using different hyperthreads, cores, CPUs, machines, etc. By contrast, an operation
  that is to run <dfn id=immediately>immediately</dfn> must interrupt the currently running task, run itself, and
  then resume the previously running task.</p>

  

  
  <p>The term "transparent black" refers to the color with red, green, blue, and alpha channels all
  set to zero.</p>


  <h4 id=resources>2.1.1 Resources<a href=#resources class=self-link></a></h4>

  <p>The specification uses the term <dfn>supported</dfn> when referring to whether a user
  agent has an implementation capable of decoding the semantics of an external resource. A format or
  type is said to be <i>supported</i> if the implementation can process an external resource of that
  format or type without critical aspects of the resource being ignored. Whether a specific resource
  is <i>supported</i> can depend on what features of the resource's format are in use.</p>

  <p class=example>For example, a PNG image would be considered to be in a supported format if its
  pixel data could be decoded and rendered, even if, unbeknownst to the implementation, the image
  also contained animation data.</p>

  <p class=example>An MPEG-4 video file would not be considered to be in a supported format if the
  compression format used was not supported, even if the implementation could determine the
  dimensions of the movie from the file's metadata.</p>

  <p>What some specifications, in particular the HTTP specification, refer to as a
  <i>representation</i> is referred to in this specification as a <dfn>resource</dfn>.
  <a href=#refsHTTP>[HTTP]</a></p>

  <p>A resource's <dfn id=critical-subresources>critical subresources</dfn> are those that the resource needs to have
  available to be correctly processed. Which resources are considered critical or not is defined by
  the specification that defines the resource's format.</p>


  <h4 id=xml>2.1.2 XML compatibility<a href=#xml class=self-link></a></h4>

  <p id=html-namespace>To ease migration from HTML to XML, UAs conforming to this specification
  will place elements in HTML in the <code id=xml:html-namespace-2><a data-x-internal=html-namespace-2 href=https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#html-namespace>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</a></code> namespace, at least for the purposes of the DOM and
  CSS. The term "<dfn id=html-elements>HTML elements</dfn>", when used in this specification, refers to any element
  in that namespace, even in XML documents.</p>

  <p>Except where otherwise stated, all elements defined or mentioned in this specification are in
  the <a id=xml:html-namespace-2-2 href=https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#html-namespace data-x-internal=html-namespace-2>HTML namespace</a> ("<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>"), and all
  attributes defined or mentioned in this specification have no namespace.</p>

  <p>The term <dfn id=element-type>element type</dfn> is used to refer to the set of elements that have a given
  local name and namespace. For example, <code id=xml:the-button-element><a href=#the-button-element>button</a></code> elements are elements with the element
  type <code id=xml:the-button-element-2><a href=#the-button-element>button</a></code>, meaning they have the local name "<code>button</code>" and
  (implicitly as defined above) the <a id=xml:html-namespace-2-3 href=https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#html-namespace data-x-internal=html-namespace-2>HTML namespace</a>.</p>

  <p>Attribute names are said to be <dfn id=xml-compatible>XML-compatible</dfn> if they match the <code id=xml:xml-name><a data-x-internal=xml-name href=https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-Name>Name</a></code> production defined in XML and they contain no U+003A COLON
  characters (:). <a href=#refsXML>[XML]</a></p>


  <h4 id=dom-trees>2.1.3 DOM trees<a href=#dom-trees class=self-link></a></h4>

  <p>When it is stated that some element or attribute is <dfn id=ignore>ignored</dfn>, or
  treated as some other value, or handled as if it was something else, this refers only to the
  processing of the node after it is in the DOM. A user agent must not mutate the
  DOM in such situations.</p>

  <p>A content attribute is said to <dfn>change</dfn> value only if its new value is
  different than its previous value; setting an attribute to a value it already has does not change
  it.</p>

  <p>The term <dfn>empty</dfn>, when used of an attribute value, <code id=dom-trees:text><a data-x-internal=text href=https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-text>Text</a></code> node, or
  string, means that the length of the text is zero (i.e. not even containing spaces or <a href=#control-characters id=dom-trees:control-characters>control
  characters</a>).</p>

  <p>An element's <dfn id=child-text-content data-export="">child text content</dfn> is the concatenation of the <a href=https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-cd-data id=dom-trees:concept-cd-data data-x-internal=concept-cd-data>data</a> of all the <code id=dom-trees:text-2><a data-x-internal=text href=https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-text>Text</a></code> nodes that are children of the
  element (ignoring any other nodes such as comments or elements), in <a id=dom-trees:tree-order href=https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-order data-x-internal=tree-order>tree order</a>.</p>

  <p>A <dfn id=nodes-are-inserted>node <var>A</var> is inserted</dfn> into a node <var>B</var>
  when the <a href=https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-insert-ext id=dom-trees:concept-node-insert-ext data-x-internal=concept-node-insert-ext>insertion steps</a> are invoked with
  <var>A</var> as the argument and <var>A</var>'s new parent is <var>B</var>. Similarly, a <dfn id=nodes-are-removed>node <var>A</var> is removed</dfn> from a node <var>B</var> when the
  <a href=https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-remove-ext id=dom-trees:concept-node-remove-ext data-x-internal=concept-node-remove-ext>removing steps</a> are invoked with <var>A</var> as the

  Analogously, a <dfn id=remove-an-element-from-a-document data-lt="removed from a document|node is removed from a document" data-export="">node is

  <h4 id=scripting-2>2.1.4 Scripting<a href=#scripting-2 class=self-link></a></h4>

  <p>The construction "a <code>Foo</code> object", where <code>Foo</code> is
  actually an interface, is sometimes used instead of the more accurate "an object implementing the
  interface <code>Foo</code>".</p>

  <p>An IDL attribute is said to be <dfn>getting</dfn> when its value is being retrieved
  (e.g. by author script), and is said to be <dfn>setting</dfn> when a new value is
  assigned to it.</p>

  <p>If a DOM object is said to be <dfn id=live>live</dfn>, then the attributes and methods on that object
  must operate on the actual underlying data, not a snapshot of the
  data.</p>


  <h4 id=plugins>2.1.5 Plugins<a href=#plugins class=self-link></a></h4>

  <p>The term <dfn id=plugin>plugin</dfn> refers to a user-agent defined set of content handlers used by the
  user agent that can take part in the user agent's rendering of a <code id=plugins:document><a href=#document>Document</a></code> object, but
  that neither act as <a href=#child-browsing-context id=plugins:child-browsing-context>child browsing contexts</a> of the
  <code id=plugins:document-2><a href=#document>Document</a></code> nor introduce any <code id=plugins:node><a data-x-internal=node href=https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-node>Node</a></code> objects to the <code id=plugins:document-3><a href=#document>Document</a></code>'s
  DOM.</p>

  <p>Typically such content handlers are provided by third parties, though a user agent can also
  designate built-in content handlers as plugins.</p>

  

  <p>A user agent must not consider the types <code id=plugins:text/plain><a data-x-internal=text/plain href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046#section-4.1.3>text/plain</a></code> and
  <code id=plugins:application/octet-stream><a data-x-internal=application/octet-stream href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046#section-4.5.1>application/octet-stream</a></code> as having a registered <a href=#plugin id=plugins:plugin>plugin</a>.</p> 

  

  <p class=example>One example of a plugin would be a PDF viewer that is instantiated in a
  <a href=#browsing-context id=plugins:browsing-context>browsing context</a> when the user navigates to a PDF file. This would count as a plugin
  regardless of whether the party that implemented the PDF viewer component was the same as that
  which implemented the user agent itself. However, a PDF viewer application that launches separate
  from the user agent (as opposed to using the same interface) is not a plugin by this
  definition.</p>

  <p class=note>This specification does not define a mechanism for interacting with plugins, as it
  is expected to be user-agent- and platform-specific. Some UAs might opt to support a plugin
  mechanism such as the Netscape Plugin API; others might use remote content converters or have
  built-in support for certain types. Indeed, this specification doesn't require user agents to
  support plugins at all. <a href=#refsNPAPI>[NPAPI]</a></p>

  <p>A plugin can be <dfn id=concept-plugin-secure>secured</dfn> if it honors the semantics of
  the <code id=plugins:attr-iframe-sandbox><a href=#attr-iframe-sandbox>sandbox</a></code> attribute.</p>

  <p class=example>For example, a secured plugin would prevent its contents from creating pop-up
  windows when the plugin is instantiated inside a sandboxed <code id=plugins:the-iframe-element><a href=#the-iframe-element>iframe</a></code>.</p>

  

  <p class=warning>Browsers should take extreme care when interacting with external content
  intended for <a href=#plugin id=plugins:plugin-2>plugins</a>. When third-party software is run with the same
  privileges as the user agent itself, vulnerabilities in the third-party software become as
  dangerous as those in the user agent.</p>

  <p>Since different users having different sets of <a href=#plugin id=plugins:plugin-3>plugins</a> provides a
  fingerprinting vector that increases the chances of users being uniquely identified, user agents
  are encouraged to support the exact same set of <a href=#plugin id=plugins:plugin-4>plugins</a> for each
  user.
